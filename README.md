# Website

## 1. Introduction

This front-end project "Road Monitoring System" is built based on the framework [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Element](https://element.eleme.cn/#/en-US) library and the [Amap](https://lbs.amap.com/) API. In addition, the login and registration pages use the  [reCAPTCHA v2](https://vuejsexamples.com/google-recaptcha-component-for-vue-js/) widget provided by Google . which provides high-level visualisation of the collected data about the road conditon.  The website has three parts "Login ", registration and "Map".
