# Model Engine Description

## Dynamical Time Warping

Dynamical Time Warping is a class of algorithms to determine the similarity between time series. Here, the algorithm is to compare the collected data from the devices with the template collected from both abnormal and normal road. This algorithm will compare the collected data with all templates. It will be determined by if the average value of the alignment with the abnormal road templates is greater than the normal templates if the collected involves the abnormal road.

## K-Means

K-Means is a clustering algorithm to partition observations into clusters that contain all samples. In this content, this algorithm is to further determine accurate circle of the abnormal road, the center and radius.
